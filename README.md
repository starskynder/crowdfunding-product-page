# Frontend Mentor - Crowdfunding product page

![Design preview for the Crowdfunding product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions).
The challenge was to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## Solution

The page is done in React, using Sass with BEM naming. <br>
